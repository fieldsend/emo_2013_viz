This is research quality code, it undoubtedly could benefit from some refactoring, and there is some wasted computation, however I hope the comments (and the published work), make it relatively easy to follow. If you find a bug (and especially if you have a fix for it) please email the author.

There are a number of supporting functions that have been sparsely commented (if commented at all), as they provide some processing which is shared across approaches; the three functions you will want to invoke directly are:

deterministic_compression_and_visualisation_closeness

deterministic_compression_and_visualisation_dominance

deterministic_compression_and_visualisation_koppenyoshida

Please use the help option for each of these methods. 

The first two undertake the visualisations described in:

Fieldsend JE, Everson RM. 
Visualising high-dimensional Pareto relationships in two-dimensional 
scatterplots, 
Evolutionary Multi-criterion Optimisation, EMO 2013.
LNCS pp 558-572

The last undertakes the visualisation described in 

M. Koppen and K. Yoshida. 
Visualization of Pareto-sets in evolutionary multi-objective  optimization. 
In Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent 
Systems, pages 156-161, Washington, DC, USA, 2007

given an already optimised permutation (Koppen and Yoshida used NSGA-II). If you have not provided a permutation for the non-dominated subset, then spectral seriation can be used instead (and is a built in option).
